        - **Probability sampling:** 
        - Four types of probability sampling
            - *Simple random sampling*
            - *Cluster sampling*
            - *Systematic sampling*
            - *Stratified sampling*
        - Uses of probability sampling
            -*Reduce sample bias*
            -*Diverse population*
            -*Create an accurate sample*

    - **Non-probability sampling**
        - *Convenience sampling*
        - *Purposive samplin*
        - *Snowbal sampling*
        - *Quota sampling*
    
    - **Uses of non-probability sampling**
        - *Create a hypothesis*
        - *Exploratory research*
        - *Budge and time constraints*

- How do you decide on the type of sampling to use?

### What are types of biases can occur during sampling?
1. `Selection bias`
2. `Undercoverage bias`
3. `Survivorship bias`

### Why is resampling done?



### 2. What is the difference between `type I` vs `type II` error?

    A type I error occurs when the null hypothesis is true, but is rejected.
    A type II error occurs when the null hypothesis is FALSE, but erroneously fails to be rejected.


### What is the importance of the `p-value`?
